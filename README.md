#### this repository contains the work for our gu-hackathon-2022 project
We built a web scraper to gather songs from the Billboard Top 100 Songs website, and then found these songs on Spotify and gathered statistics about these songs using the Spotify API. We then compared results from the previous decades, and looked for trends in our data to help identify what exactly makes a song popular.
